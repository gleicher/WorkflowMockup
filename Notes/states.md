Kinds of Things
+ Task to check off on (sign off)
+ Task to do before proceeding
+ Activity (thing to do that helps - but doesn't check off)

Availability
+ Can do now
+ Can't do now unless "skip" steps - missing preconditions that could be guessed
+ Can't do now (missing pre-conditions)
+ Already done - but could do more
+ Already done - redoing means changing (potentially undoing downstream)

Status
+ Not visited (nothing done on it)
+ Visited (some done, could do more)
+ Checked off (could look at choice - or change)
+ Guessed (could revisit and make choice)

## The "Workflow"

0. Examine Data

Phase 1:

1. Edit/Examine the problem definition
2. Sign off on problem 
3. Provision backends
4. Start Backends

Phase 2:

5. Monitor back-end progress
6. Control process (cut-off laggard backends)

Phase 3:

7. Examine Summary of Model Results
8. Get Overview of model performance

9. Interpret Metrics
10. Refine Metrics

11. Select Metric

Phase 4:

12. Examine model results in detail
13. Compare models

14. Select models

Phase 5:

15. Build final model / executable
16. Test/experiment/validate executable

## Observations:

Activities should be available at any time (that they are available)
+ They are optional - but always useful
+ Some may be "recommended" for the current task at hand
+ Could always be skipped (don't look, just choose in an uninformed way)

The "next task" is really the focus
+ suggest activities that might help with the task
+ tasks are sequential - but activities can interleave arbitrarily
+ tasks can have "automation over-rides" (just guess for me)
+ tasks are informed by activities - but only have other tasks as preconditions

Tasks have:
+ Preconditions (what do you need)
+ Suggested activities (things that might help you do what you need to)
+ Default choice (I don't know - pick for me)
+ Review/Redo (how catastrophic is it to "undo" once done)
+ Things provides (what 

Activities have:
+ Preconditions (what needs to be in place)
